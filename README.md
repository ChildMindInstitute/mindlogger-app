### Widget development

[See the widget development guide](https://github.com/ChildMindInstitute/mindlogger-app/blob/master/widget-development.md)

### Prerequisites

For example
```
npm -v

## Release build

### Bitrise

Continuous integration: changes to the master branch will be automatically built through [Bitrise](https://app.bitrise.io/app/68551a54551c4340).
